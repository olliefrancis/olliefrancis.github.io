		<h1>Hi, I'm Ollie Francis. I'm a UX consultant, product designer and mentor based in Bristol, UK</h1>
		<h2><strong>I remove fear and help change behaviour around technology so that the people I work with can be more pragmatic and embrace change. I enable leaders and their teams to build more user-centred digital products that benefit society and human culture.</strong></h2>
		<p>I founded UX design consultancy <a href="https://www.deckchair.co.uk" target="_blank">Deckchair</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-l-taylor/" target="_blank">Becky Taylor</a>. We work with teams to discover user needs and define business problems. I rapidly build prototypes to test with real users in days rather than weeks. My aim is to create a safe space for teams to thrive.</p>
  	  	<p>I have worked with teams on digital products and services for the NHS, Department of Health, University of Reading, H&M and the UK Space Agency.</p>
		<p>I mentor individuals and teams looking to improve their UX process and practice. I've worked with leaders to change organisational culture and helped lots of people find a new path in their careers.</p>
		<p>Like many designers, I'm a frustrated artist at heart, exploring the world through talks, writing and making, to express myself. I am currently very interested in using game dynamics and the blockchain to save the planet.</p>
		<h3>Products I've designed</h3>

	      </li>
		  <li>
		    <p><a href="https://www.untaggedfashion.com/" target="_blank">Untagged Fashion</a> - An app that uses gaming dynamics to swap old clothes for tokens, so you can get something new to you and help slow down fast fashion.</p>

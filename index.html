		<h1>I'm Ollie Francis. I'm a UX consultant, product designer and mentor based in Bristol, UK</h1>
		<h2><strong>I remove fear and help change behaviour around technology so that the people I work with can be more pragmatic and embrace change. I enable leaders and their teams to build more user-centred digital products that benefit society and human culture.</strong></h2>
		<p>I founded UX design consultancy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VywuOf8IKY" target="_blank">Deckchair</a> with Becky Taylor. We work with teams to discover user needs and define business problems. We rapidly build prototypes to test with real users in days rather than weeks. We create a safe space for teams to thrive.
  	  	<p>I have worked with teams on digital products and services for the NHS, Department of Health, University of Reading, H&M and the UK Space Agency.</p>
		<p>I mentor individuals and teams looking to improve their UX process and practice, and I've helped lots of people find a new path in their design careers.</p>
		<p>Like many designers, I'm a frustrated artist at heart, exploring the world through talks, writing and making, to express myself. I am very interested in using game dynamics and the blockchain to save the planet.</p>
		<p><strong>Products I have loved working on recently are:</strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>
		    <p><a href="https://www.prestomusic.com/streaming" target="_blank">Presto Music</a> - Specialist music streaming service built for classical and jazz lovers, by classical and jazz lovers.</p>
	      </li>
		  <li>
		    <p><a href="https://www.untaggedfashion.com/" target="_blank">Untagged Fashion</a> - App that uses gaming dynamics to swap old clothes for tokens, so you can get something new and slow down fast fashion.</p>
	      </li>
		  <li>
		    <p><a href="https://www.sparkyard.com/" target="_blank">Sparkyard</a> - Music streaming service and educational resource for schools, to get kids learning and thriving by singing.</p>

	  </ul>
